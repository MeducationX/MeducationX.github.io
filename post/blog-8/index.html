    From a young age, you’re taught to always make sure you receive the prepper vitamins every day. But what do you really know about them? Why should you take vitamins every day? Read to learn more about vitamins and what each specific vitamin does!
</p>
<h2>
    What are Vitamins?
</h2>
<p>
    Vitamins are organic substances, so they contain carbon. They are fundamental nutrients that the body may need to obtain from foods, and are for the most part classified as either fat soluble or water soluble. They are in numerous organic nourishments, and lost in numerous processed ones. In this way, eating organic fruits and vegetables is significant in making sure you receive the proper amount of vitamins a day. Such foods include organic products, vegetables, beans, lentils, entirety grains, and invigorated dairy nourishments. These may prevent health issues like heart illness, cancer, and ruin bone strength (osteoporosis). Taking supplements will guarantee you get all your vitamins, but it is way better to obtain your vitamins from nourishments.
</p>
<h2>
    Vitamin A
</h2>
<p>
    Vitamin A helps maintain solid teeth, bones, delicate tissue, mucous membranes, and skin. Vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin that's found in seafood like fish, organ meats (such as liver), dairy items, and eggs. Provitamin A carotenoids are turned into vitamin A by your body. They are found in natural products, vegetables, fruits, and other plant-based items. The foremost common provitamin A carotenoid in nourishments and dietary supplements is beta-carotene.
</p>
<p>
    Vitamin A supplements are prescribed for children with measles who are at an increased chance of vitamin A deficiency. Research recommends that supplementation might diminish passing due to measles. Vitamin A insufficiency also causes iron deficiency and dry eyes. Therefore, it can be destructive if used irresponsibly. Indeed a single huge dosage — over 200,000 mcg — can cause:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Nausea</li>
    <li>Vomiting</li>
    <li>Vertigo</li>
    <li>Blurry vision</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
    Taking more than 3,000 mcg a day of verbal vitamin A supplements long term can cause:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bone thinning</li>
    <li>Liver damage</li>
    <li>Headache</li>
    <li>Diarrhea</li>
    <li>Nausea</li>
    <li>Skin irritation</li>
    <li>Pain in the joints and bone</li>
    <li>Birth defects</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <br>
</p>
<h2>
    Vitamin B1
</h2>
<p>
    Vitamin B1 helps convert food into vitality and is the basis of nerve function. Thiamine (or thiamin) is a water-soluble B vitamin. Turning carbohydrates into energy makes a difference. It functions as a coenzyme in glycolysis. Thiamine may be a chemical cofactor that is part of the citric acid cycle and influences energy acquisition from acetyl-CoA. Thus, it may play an important role in ATP generation. . It is necessary for strong skin, hair, muscles, and brain, and is the basis of nerve function. Foods with this vitamin are pork chops, brown rice, ham, soy milk, watermelons, and acorn squash.
</p>
<h2>
    Vitamin B2
</h2>
<p>
    Vitamin B2 is a part of FMN and FAD, which help convert food into energy and are involved in the electron transport chain, a necessary part of cellular respiration. It helps maintain healthy skin, hair, blood, and brain. Riboflavin contributes to the body's antioxidant defense system. Foods with this vitamin include milk, eggs, yogurt, cheese, meat, leafy green vegetables, whole grains, fortified grains, and cereals. This nutrient is usually obtained by most Americans because it is in common foods.
</p>
<h2>
    Vitamin B3
</h2>
<p>
    Vitamin B3 helps convert food into energy. It is essential for healthy skin, blood cells, brain, and the nervous system. In particular, niacin is a major component of NAD and NADP, two coenzymes involved in cellular metabolism. Additionally, it not only acts as an antioxidant, but also plays a role in cell signaling, DNA production, and repair. This vitamin is in foods like meat, poultry, fish, fortified and whole grains, mushrooms, potatoes, and peanut butter. Niacin is found naturally in food and can also be produced in the body from the amino acid tryptophan with the help of vitamin B3. Make sure you consume foods that have enough carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen.
</p>
<h2>
    Vitamin B5
</h2>
<p>
    Vitamin B5 helps convert food into energy, form lipids (fats), transmit neurotransmitters, regulate steroid hormones, and manage hemoglobin. During fat digestion, it plays a role in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA (CoA) and acyl carrier proteins. CoA is essential for fatty acid synthesis and breakdown, acetyl and acyl group transfer, and various other anabolic and catabolic processes. It plays an important role in the formation of hemoglobin and the production of sex hormones in the adrenal glands. A wide selection of nutritious foods including chicken, egg yolks, whole grains, broccoli, mushrooms, avocados, and tomato products contain B5. Deficiency in B5 causes a burning sensation in the feet and other neurological symptoms.
</p>
<h2>
    Vitamin B6
</h2>
<p>
    Vitamin B6, also known as pyridoxine, is important for the brain, nervous, and immune system health. This is a water-soluble vitamin and is found in chicken, fish, potatoes, chickpeas, bananas, and fortified grains. Vitamin B6 indirectly supports brain function by lowering homocysteine ​​levels, as high levels of homocysteine ​​in the body are associated with higher rates of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and cognitive decline. The more protein you consume, the more pyridoxine your body needs. Vitamin B6 deficiency may manifest as seizures, altered mental status, anemia, skin rash, and glossitis. It plays an important role in neurotransmitter synthesis, inhibits the release of neurotoxic glutamate, and restores sensory nerve function. In some people, vitamin B6 can cause nausea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, headaches, and other side effects. High doses of vitamin B6, especially more than 1000 mg daily, can cause brain and nerve problems; it is extremely dangerous. Patients typically experience symptoms such as peripheral neuropathy, skin disease, photosensitivity, dizziness, and nausea when using doses above 250 mg/day for long periods of time.
</p>
<h2>
    Vitamin B7
</h2>
<p>
    Many enzymes involved in the metabolism of macronutrients such as proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates require biotin as a cofactor. These nutrients are converted by these enzymes into a source that the body can use for energy. In addition, the synthesis of fatty acids, which are important components of cell membranes and involved in many physiological functions such as hormone formation and signal transduction, depends on biotin. Leucine and isoleucine are two examples of amino acids that biotin helps break down and uses in various metabolic processes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Gluconeogenesis is the process by which glucose is synthesized from non-carbohydrate sources and requires biotin. Maintaining blood sugar levels is especially important on an empty stomach and during prolonged physical activity. Biotin also affects the expression of genes by altering the activity of certain transcription factors, which are proteins that control the transcription of genes into messenger RNA (mRNA) and subsequently affect protein synthesis. Biotin occurs naturally in a variety of foods including egg yolks, nuts and seeds, meat, fish, dairy products, vegetables, and whole grain products. Symptoms of biotin deficiency include but are not limited to hair loss or thinning of the hair; red scaly rash around the eyes, nose, and mouth; and conjunctivitis. Neurological symptoms such as depression, lethargy, hallucinations, and numbness or tingling in the extremities are also involved with biotin deficiency.
</p>
<h2>
    Vitamin B12
</h2>
<p>
    Vitamin B12 helps lower homocysteine ​​levels and may reduce the risk of heart disease. It helps form new cells and break down some fatty acids and amino acids, protects nerve cells, and promotes normal growth. It also helps form red blood cells and DNA. Foods rich in B12 include meat, poultry, fish, milk, cheese, eggs, fortified cereals, and fortified soy milk. Some people, especially older people, are deficient in vitamin B12 because they have problems absorbing it from food. People who follow a vegan or vegetarian diet often don't get enough vitamin B12, which is found primarily in animal foods. Such people may need to take supplements. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause memory loss, dementia, and numbness in the arms and legs.
</p>
<h2>
    Vitamin C
</h2>
<p>
    Foods rich in vitamin C may reduce the risk of some cancers, including mouth cancer, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and breast cancer. Taking vitamin C supplements long-term may help prevent cataracts. It helps form collagen, the connective tissue that binds wounds together and supports blood vessel walls. It also helps form the neurotransmitters serotonin and noradrenaline, and it acts as an antioxidant, neutralizing unstable molecules that can damage cells. It is used to strengthen the immune system, which is why it is important to ingest this vitamin. Fruits and fruit juices (especially citrus fruits), potatoes, broccoli, peppers, spinach, strawberries, tomatoes, and brussels sprouts all contain Vitamin C.
</p>
<h2>
    Vitamin D
</h2>
<p>
    One of the main functions of vitamin D is to improve the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the intestines. This is important for maintaining healthy bones and teeth. Vitamin D is very important for bone health because it helps mineralize bones and prevents conditions such as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. As we advance, there is increasing evidence that vitamin D plays a role in regulating the immune system and may help reduce the risk of certain autoimmune diseases and infections. In addition, vitamin D is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (programmed cell death), which are important processes in cancer prevention.
</p>
<p>
    The main natural source of vitamin D is sunlight. Vitamin D3 is synthesized when the skin is exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from the sun. Although not abundant, some foods naturally contain vitamin D or are fortified with vitamin D. Fortified foods such as fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, and tuna), egg yolks, milk, orange juice, and breakfast cereals are sources of vitamin D.&nbsp; Many people do not get enough of this nutrient. For this reason, vitamin D supplements can be taken. Vitamin D supplements are commonly available and recommended for people who have limited sun exposure, live in areas with low sunlight, or have conditions that affect vitamin D absorption.
</p>
<h2>
    Vitamin E
</h2>
<p>
    Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, neutralizing unstable molecules that can damage cells. A diet rich in vitamin E can help prevent Alzheimer's disease. Vitamin E, a fat-soluble antioxidant, provides several health benefits. It protects cells from free radical damage, moisturizes the skin barrier, reduces scars/stretch marks, supports wound healing, prevents oxidation of LDL cholesterol, and may reduce cardiovascular risk. It also supports immune cell function and response, protects against age-related macular degeneration, reduces inflammation and is beneficial for conditions such as arthritis, and it may protect against cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. It is extremely important for sperm production, motility, and healthy pregnancy. A wide range of foods including salad dressings and margarine made from vegetable oils, vegetable oils, wheat germ, green leafy vegetables, whole grains, and nuts contain this vitamin.
</p>
<h2>
    Vitamin K
</h2>
<p>
    Vitamin K activates proteins and calcium that are important for blood clotting. It may help prevent hip fractures. Vitamin K, a fat-soluble vitamin, has several benefits. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and wound healing through the production of clotting factors. It supports bone mineralization, reduces fracture risk, and regulates calcium levels. In addition, it may reduce risk of cardiovascular disease by inhibiting arteriosclerosis. New research suggests that it plays a role in brain health that may protect against Alzheimer's disease. There is also hope that it can aid in preventing prostate cancer and liver cancer. Vitamin K maintains skin elasticity and reduces diseases such as arthritis. Foods rich in vitamin K include cabbage, liver, eggs, milk, spinach, broccoli, bean sprouts, kale, collards, and other green vegetables.
